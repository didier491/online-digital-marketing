<h1>introduction on Digital Marketing</h1>
<p>Digital marketing typically refers to online marketing campaigns that appear on a computer, phone, tablet, or other device.<br/> It can take many forms, including online video, display ads, search engine marketing, paid social ads, and social media posts. Digital marketing is often compared to “traditional marketing” such as magazine ads, billboards, and direct mail. Oddly, television is usually lumped in with traditional marketing.</p>

<p>Digital marketing, also called online marketing, is the promotion of brands to connect with potential customers using the Internet and other forms of digital communication. This includes not only email, social media, and web-based advertising, but also text and multimedia messages as a marketing channel.</p>

<p>If you are observing significant numbers of clicks but a poor conversion rate, one of the likely causes is the audience itself. You may be spending the majority of your digital marketing in the poorly performing channels targeting the wrong audience.
