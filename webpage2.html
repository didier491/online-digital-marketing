<h1>History of Digital Marketing</h1>
<p>When the Archie search engine was developed in 1990 as an index for File Transfer Protocol sites, digital marketing really got underway. Computer storage became sufficiently large in the 1980s to accommodate massive amounts of consumer data. Businesses began to use internet strategies over restricted list brokers, such as database marketing  (London, 2010) Databases changed the dynamic between buyer and seller by enabling businesses to track client information more efficiently.
The phrase "digital marketing" was first used in the 1990s. The rise in the use of personal computers and the development of server/client architecture made CRM (customer relationship management) programmers an important component of marketing technology. Vendors were compelled by intense rivalry to provide new services, like marketing, sales, and service applications, to their software. With the advent of the Internet, marketers were also able to obtain online client data by use of eCRM software. This resulted in the "You Will" campaign by AT&T being the first clickable banner ad to go live in 1994. In its first four months of operation, 44% of all viewers clicked on the advertisement.
Customers started conducting their needs research and product searches online in the 2000s, rather than speaking with salespeople, due to the rise in Internet users and the release of the iPhone. This presented a new challenge for marketing departments at businesses. Furthermore, a UK poll conducted in 2000 discovered that the majority of retailers are still required to acquire their own domain name. These issues compelled marketers to devise fresh approaches for incorporating digital technology into market expansion.</p>
